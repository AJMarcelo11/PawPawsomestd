Dogs have very sensitive skin, thatâ€™s why this soap is perfect for them. It is made from pure coconut, olive, shea butter, cocoa butter, castor oil and lavender, citronella and lemongrass essential oils. Blended together for their anti-bacterial, healing and soothing properties. The soap is very lathery which helps to lift fleas and eggs out of their fur. Stop your pet suffering the natural way.
